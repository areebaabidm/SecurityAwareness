# Privacy

Privacy is the fundamental right that allows individuals or groups to selectively disclose personal information and control its dissemination. It involves the ability to maintain confidentiality and autonomy over one's data and expressions.

PII, or Personally Identifiable Information, encompasses any data that can be utilised to identify an individual. It comprises a wide array of information that distinguishes or traces an individual's identity. Examples of PII include:

1. **Name**: Any given name or full name of an individual.
2. **ID Number**: Unique identification numbers such as social security, passport, or driver's license numbers.
3. **Date of Birth**: Specific birth dates or age-related information.
4. **Location Details**: Addresses, GPS coordinates, or any geolocation information.
5. **Biometric Record**: Physical or behavioural characteristics like fingerprints, iris scans, or voiceprints.
6. **Medical History**: Health records, diagnoses, or treatment information.
7. **Driving License**: Official documentation permitting an individual to operate a vehicle.
8. **Financial Information**: Bank account details, credit card numbers, or income specifics.
9. **Employment Details**: Information regarding an individual's job, occupation, or professional history.

Maintaining privacy and safeguarding PII is crucial to protect individuals from potential identity theft, financial fraud, or unwarranted invasions of personal space. It is essential to be mindful of how and where this information is shared to ensure a secure and respectful handling of personal data.
